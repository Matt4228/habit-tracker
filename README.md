# HabitTracker

## COMP 426 Final Project

**A great way to build healthy habits and consistency in your everyday life.**

side note: miketravels and mikeroams are both Michael

### Frontend: Interactive and Event-Driven
- We used Angular to create a responsive front end that includes:
  - A user's habit dashboard
  - Login screen
  - Register screen

### Backend: Persistent and RESTful
- Built using MySQL, our backend supports:
  - Session-persistent state
  - A RESTful CRUD API to track habits across user sessions and allow updates as necessary

### Integration with Third-Party API
- HabitTracker leverages ZenQuotes' public API to provide users with a new random motivational quote every time they visit the habit dashboard.
