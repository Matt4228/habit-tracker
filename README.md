# HabitTracker
COMPP 426 Final Project
side note: miketravels and mikeroams are both Michael

A great way to build healthy habits and consistency in your everyday life

-front end that is interactive and event-driven:
We used angular to create a responsive front end which consists of a users habit dashboard, login screen, and register screen

-back end that serves at least two resources with a RESTful CRUD (create, read, update, and delete) API and session-persistent state  
Our backend we built using MySQL which allows the user to track habits that persist beyond the single user session and update them as necessary

-Uses at least one 3rd party API
HabitTracker makes use of zenquotes' public API to provide users with a new random motivational quote every time they visit the habit dashboard
